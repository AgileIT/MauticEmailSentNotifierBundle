## FAQ

### What is the Webhook URL parameter?

This is the Web Address (HTTP, HTTPS) that will be called after Mautic sends a
new email !

### What is the API Key Parameter?

The API Key parameter will be sent along with the HTTP request so that this
could be validated at your server. It's just a signature for validating the
request if wanted :)

### Why do I need to fill in the Mautic Base Url?

This parameter will be used for composing the JSON message, adding a field called
"viewUrl". This link contains the web address in which the Mautic Email can be
viewed using a Web Browser
